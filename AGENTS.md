# Agent guide — atoms

## What this is

A recoverable filesystem effect engine — the physical durability substrate below
`nodes`. See [`README.md`](README.md) for the layering and `docs/plans/` for the design.

## Status: pre-implementation

There is no production code yet. The only authority is the design under `docs/plans/`,
carried verbatim from science. Per the design's own roadmap, do **not** write
implementation plans or production code until the owner approves the replacement
design; after approval, write and review Plan A before implementation, and Plan B only
after Plan A's interfaces settle.

## Authority order

1. [`docs/plans/2026-07-23-recoverable-fs-effect-engine-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-07-23-recoverable-fs-effect-engine-design.md)
   — **the authority design** for the standalone `atoms` engine (SQLite-in-WAL metadata store; §14 is
   the delivery roadmap: Plan A = engine + synthetic exerciser, Plan B = adoption). Under owner review.
   When a future `STANDARD`/spec supersedes it, update this note.
2. The 2026-07-20 design and roadmap are **superseded**, retained only as the historical record of the
   review that hardened the capability, capture, effect, materialization, and recovery contracts.
   Their `Package: science` framing is pre-extraction rationale, not the current package boundary.

## Conventions

- Fail early; no silent fallbacks.
- Composition over inheritance.
- Filepaths in docs use `~/d/atoms/...`.
- No AI-attribution trailers in commit messages, PRs, or comments.
